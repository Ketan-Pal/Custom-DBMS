# Custom Java DBMS Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture and implementation approach for building a relational Database Management System (DBMS) from scratch using Java. The system is divided into multiple components, each handling specific aspects of database functionality.

## 1. SQL Query Parser and Compiler

### Design Pattern
- Use the Interpreter pattern for parsing SQL statements
- Implement Visitor pattern for traversing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

### Implementation Approach
1. Lexical Analysis
   - Use ANTLR4 (Another Tool for Language Recognition) for generating the lexer
   - Define SQL grammar rules in ANTLR4 format
   - Generate tokens from SQL statements

2. Syntax Analysis
   - Generate parser using ANTLR4
   - Build Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
   - Implement syntax validation

3. Semantic Analysis
   - Validate table and column references
   - Check type compatibility
   - Resolve aliases and references

### Key Libraries
- ANTLR4 (org.antlr:antlr4:4.13.0)
- Apache Commons Lang

## 2. Query Execution Engine and Optimizer

### Design Pattern
- Strategy pattern for different execution strategies
- Factory pattern for operator creation

### Implementation Approach
1. Query Plan Generation
   - Convert AST to logical query plan
   - Implement basic algebraic operators (SELECT, PROJECT, JOIN)
   - Create cost-based optimizer

2. Plan Optimization
   - Implement rule-based optimization
   - Push down predicates
   - Join order optimization
   - Cardinality estimation

3. Execution
   - Implement iterator model (open-next-close)
   - Pipeline execution where possible
   - Materialization when necessary

## 3. Storage Manager

### Design Pattern
- Singleton pattern for buffer pool manager
- Factory pattern for page creation

### Implementation Approach
1. Page Layout
   - Fixed-size pages (typically 4KB or 8KB)
   - Slotted page structure for variable-length records
   - Page header with metadata

2. Buffer Pool Management
   - LRU replacement policy
   - Dirty page tracking
   - Pin/unpin mechanism

3. File Organization
   - Table heap files
   - Sequential file organization
   - Implement RAID-like striping for performance

### Key Libraries
- java.nio for efficient I/O
- Memory-mapped files using MappedByteBuffer

## 4. Concurrency Control

### Design Pattern
- Proxy pattern for lock management
- Template method for transaction execution

### Implementation Approach
1. Locking Mechanism
   - Implement two-phase locking (2PL)
   - Support multiple granularities (row, page, table)
   - Deadlock detection and prevention

2. MVCC (Multiversion Concurrency Control)
   - Timestamp-based versioning
   - Version chain management
   - Garbage collection for old versions

## 5. Transaction Management

### Design Pattern
- Command pattern for transaction operations
- Observer pattern for transaction events

### Implementation Approach
1. Transaction Control
   - Begin, commit, abort operations
   - Savepoint management
   - Recovery management integration

2. ACID Properties
   - Atomicity through logging
   - Consistency through constraints
   - Isolation through concurrency control
   - Durability through WAL

## 6. Indexing

### Design Pattern
- Composite pattern for index structures
- Iterator pattern for index scanning

### Implementation Approach
1. B+ Tree Implementation
   - Node structure design
   - Split and merge operations
   - Bulk loading capability

2. Hash Index
   - Extensible hashing
   - Collision resolution
   - Dynamic resizing

## 7. Logging and Recovery

### Design Pattern
- Chain of responsibility for log processing
- Memento pattern for checkpoints

### Implementation Approach
1. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
   - Log record format design
   - Buffer management for logs
   - Force-at-commit policy

2. Recovery Mechanism
   - ARIES recovery algorithm
   - Checkpoint mechanism
   - Redo and undo operations

## 8. Network Protocol

### Design Pattern
- Reactor pattern for connection handling
- Command pattern for protocol messages

### Implementation Approach
1. Connection Management
   - NIO-based server implementation
   - Connection pooling
   - Authentication and authorization

2. Protocol Implementation
   - Custom wire protocol design
   - Message framing
   - Request/response handling

### Key Libraries
- Netty for network communication
- Java NIO

## 9. Query Optimization

### Implementation Approach
1. Statistics Collection
   - Histogram maintenance
   - Sampling techniques
   - Cardinality estimation

2. Caching
   - Query result cache
   - Page cache
   - Metadata cache
